Winfetch Plus! is based on [Winfetch by lptstr](https://github.com/lptstr/winfetch) and a [modified version by AB10110f](https://github.com/AB10110F/Winfetch-Themes) and is a command-line system information utility written in PowerShell 5+. Winfetch displays information about your operating system, software and hardware in an aesthetic and visually pleasing way.

The overall purpose of Winfetch is to be used in screenshots of your system. Winfetch shows the information other people want to see. There are other tools available for proper system statistic/diagnostics.

The information by default is displayed alongside your operating system's logo. You can further configure Winfetch to instead use an image, your wallpaper or nothing at all.

Plus! adds new features and a bit of cleanup in how it looks. Some of which are:

* Two languages (English and Japanese)
* Temperature output for the CPU
* Amount of space left (instead of space used)
* Able to show a redacted public IP instead of your actual public IP
* Gives you a haiku or a dumb quote

According to [benchmarks](https://github.com/lptstr/winfetch/wiki/Winfetch-vs-Neofetch), Winfetch on Windows is faster than [Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) running on Bash emulators like MSYS (Git Bash) or Cygwin.
